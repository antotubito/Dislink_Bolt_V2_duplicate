## üîß TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Short-term (Next 2 weeks)
1. **Performance Optimization**
   ```typescript
   // Implement React.memo for expensive components
   export const ContactCard = React.memo(({ contact }: ContactCardProps) => {
     // Component implementation
   });
   
   // Add useMemo for expensive calculations
   const filteredContacts = useMemo(() => {
     return contacts.filter(contact => 
       contact.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
     );
   }, [contacts, searchQuery]);
   ```

2. **Error Monitoring Enhancement**
   ```typescript
   // Add more detailed error tracking
   const trackUserAction = (action: string, success: boolean, error?: Error) => {
     captureMessage(`User Action: ${action}`, {
       level: success ? 'info' : 'error',
       extra: { success, error: error?.message }
     });
   };
   ```

3. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   ```typescript
   // Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
   const HeavyComponent = lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));
   
   // Use React.lazy with error boundaries
   <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
     <HeavyComponent />
   </Suspense>
   ```
