# 🚀 Enhanced Onboarding Platform Management

## 📋 **Overview**

I've implemented a completely redesigned onboarding flow for social platform management that addresses all your requirements:

1. **Always-visible manual URL input bar** at the top
2. **Category-based platform selection** with collapsible sections
3. **Username-only input modal** that appears when clicking platform logos
4. **Automatic URL formatting** based on platform requirements

## ✨ **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Top Bar - Manual URL Input**
- **Always visible** at the top of the onboarding step
- **Smart URL detection** - automatically detects platform from pasted URLs
- **One-click addition** - paste any social media URL and it's automatically added
- **Fallback support** - unrecognized URLs are added as "website" links

### **2. Category-Based Platform Selection**
- **8 organized categories**:
  - 🏢 Professional (LinkedIn, GitHub, Behance, Dribbble, Portfolio)

  - ❤️ Support (Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee)

  - 🎵 Music (Spotify, SoundCloud)
  - 🎮 Gaming (Steam, Xbox, PlayStation)

### **3. Username-Only Input Modal**
- **Click any platform logo** to open a clean modal

### **4. Enhanced User Experience**
